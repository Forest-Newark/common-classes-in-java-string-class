3. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/tiy-raleigh-java/common-classes-in-java-string-class) using the `git clone` command:

	`git clone git@github.com:tiy-raleigh-java/common-classes-in-java-string-class.git`

	This should create a new directory at `~/Projects/common-classes-in-java-string-class`.
